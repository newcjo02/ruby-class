## David Newcomer - Introduction
### What is your programming experience like?

I've been a full time software engineer for about six years. My primary development languages are Java, C++, and Python. I also have experience writing Scala, Swift, Clojure, Groovy, C#, and a little bit of Objective C.

### Why are you exciting about taking this course?

Learning new programming languages is always exciting, and this will be my first time using Ruby On Rails. I've also looked at the syllabus, and I'm looking forward to some good projects.

### What do you hope to get out of this course for your professional career?

I hope to expand my toolkit of development languages. I tend to learn new programming paradigms as I'm exposed to new languages, and I think that improves my coding style as a whole.
